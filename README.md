# MicroChallenge: detecting the surroundings 

## Areas of interests:

In our discussions, we found some areas of common interest such as an interest in sensors and a digital alter ego that could represent feedback from surroundings

## Research
By intersecting our research, we found a common point in looking for wearables that collect data in certain social contexts, from events to everyday life, also related to the concept of protection. Certain types of sensors can detect changes in our surroundings that affect our bodies and our attitude under the circumstances.

### Statement:
Series of investigation on electronic wearables that detect the surroundings and the interations with them, and that translate it in a digital visualization

### Ultrasonic Sensor :

The HC-SR04 sensor uses ultrasonic transducers to detect objects.

Its operation consists of emitting an ultrasonic sound from one of its transducers, and waiting for the sound to bounce off any present object, with the echo being captured by the second transducer. The distance is proportional to the time it takes for the echo to arrive.
