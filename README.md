# MicroChallenge: detecting the surroundings 

## Areas of interests:

In our discussions, we found some areas of common interest such as an interest in sensors and a digital alter ego that could represent feedback from surroundings

## Research
By intersecting our research, we found a common point in looking for wearables that collect data in certain social contexts, from events to everyday life, also related to the concept of protection. Certain types of sensors can detect changes in our surroundings that affect our bodies and our attitude under the circumstances.

### Statement:
Series of investigation on electronic wearables that detect the surroundings and the interations with them, and that translate it in a digital visualization

## Fabrication process

our fisrt main idea was to create a outfit, composed by a belt and a skin wearable that allow to collect data while the person who is wearing them is constantly reacting with the surroundings, ad then, translating then in a digial identity made of the data.
we started cooking the conductive biomaterial for creating a touch sensor that works even with pressure
Recipe: 
  **alginato de Sodio  + CMC Celulosa**
  Agua 200ml 
  Alginato de sodio 8g 
  CMC Celulosa 12,5g 
  Glicerina 10g 
  Harina  100 g 
  Carbon 
After discussing together we realize that for the time we had and the tests we supposed to do with the biomaterial, we decided to dedicate ourselfs to the sensors, as the proximity.

During the first review the professors suggested us to use cameras for recordigns video of the surroundings and have a sort of 360 view (as the cars have in their assets) related also to the topic of safety and protection we want  to address; so, we start investigating with the TTPO cameras.

we also tried to make a touch sensor with textiles and the **velostat**: 
*Carbon impregnated black polyethylene film. Conductivity is not affected by humidity or aging*
-Pressure and bend sensor
-Resistance decreases across distance and changes under pressure. 
-<500 Ohms/cm
-Carbon impregnated black polyethylene film. Conductivity is not affected by humidity or aging.

## Fabrication files
### code that we used:
int TRIG = 2;
int ECHO = 4;
int DURATION;
int DISTANCE;

void setup() {  
  // Sensore ad ultrasuoni
  pinMode(TRIG, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ECHO, INPUT);
 
  // Seriale
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(TRIG, HIGH);
  delay(1);
  digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW);
  DURATION = pulseIn(ECHO, HIGH);
  DISTANCE = DURATION / 58.2;
 
  if (DISTANCE > 0 && DISTANCE < 50) {
    Serial.println(DISTANCE);
    delay(100);
  }
}
